# Functional Additive Index Model with Constraints

This script (`faim_with_constraints.py`) implements a functional additive-index model with constraints using Python and the `scipy.optimize` module. The model allows for the estimation of parameters whilst incorporating constraints, such as fixing certain coefficients or intercepts to specific values.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy

## Installation

You can install the required packages via pip:

`pip install numpy scipy sql`

## Usage

1. Place the `faim_with_constraints.py` script in your project directory.

2. Define your data and constraints within the script or import them from external sources.

3. Execute the script using Python: `python faim_with_constraints.py`

4. The script will optimise the model parameters according to the provided constraints and output the optimised parameters.

## Customisation

- Modify the `functional_additive_index_model` function to suit your specific modelling needs.
- Adjust the example data (`X` and `y`) and constraints according to your requirements.
- You can extend the script to handle more complex constraints or different optimisation algorithms as needed.
